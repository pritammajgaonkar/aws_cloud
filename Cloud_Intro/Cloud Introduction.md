# What is cloud ?

Cloud computing is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

### Cloud technology means :
    In the simplest terms, cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the 
    Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The cloud is just a metaphor for the Internet.
    You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don’t realise it. If you use an 
    online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games
    or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible
    behind the scenes.
Here are a few of the things you can do with the cloud:
  - Create new apps and services
  - Store, back up and recover data
  - Host websites and blogs
  - Stream audio and video
  - Deliver software on demand

### 1. Cost Savings
### 2. High Speed
### 3. Back-up and restore data
### 4. Automatic Software Integration
### 5. Reliability
### 6. Mobility
### 7. Unlimited storage capacity
### 8. Quick Deployment

# WHY TO USE CLOUD COMPUTING ?

### Here are some common reasons organisations are turning to cloud computing services :
### 1. Cost
    Pay as you go (eg: rent)
### 2. Speed
    Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand. 10 time faster than local.
### 3. Global scale
    The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak,
    that means delivering the right amount of IT resources.
### 4. Productivity
    On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware set up, software patching and other time-consuming IT management chores.
### 5. Performance
    A cloud computing performance is very fast because it changes and upgrades day to day in a single 
    datacenter.
### 6. Reliability
    Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier and less 
    expensive, because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

# Deployment Models
### 1. Public Cloud : 
    The Public Cloud can be aceess anyone use it in company individual. made available to the general 
    public.
### 2. Private Cloud :
    The Private Cloud Owned By one Organizaton. Only he/she can access.
### 3. Community Cloud :
    The cloud infrastructure is shared by several organizations and supports a specific community that 
    has shared concerns (e.g. mission, security requirements, policy, or compliance considerations). It 
    may be managed by the organizations or by a third party and may be located on-premises or 
    off-premises.
### 4. Hybrid Cloud :
    It is Combination of two or more cloud models (private, community, or public).
# Cloud Services Models
### 1. On-Premises :
    Go to the market and buy all the ingredients(dough, spices, cheese, etc). Take it home and make it 
    raw and put in the oven and that’s it..Enjoy your pizza. In terms of Cloud Computing, this process is termed as On-Premises where you do everything on your own
### 2. Infrastructure As A Service(IaaS) :
    You can go to the market and buy a raw prepared pizza. You take it home, bake it and enjoy it. In 
    terms of Cloud Computing, this process is termed as Infrastructure As A Service(IaaS) where you 
    leverage the services of someone else to make your work a bit easier
### 3. Platform As A Service(PaaS) :
    You can go to the market and buy a baked prepared hot pizza. Take it to your place and enjoy it with 
    a drink. In terms of Cloud Computing, this process is termed as Platform As A Service(PaaS) where you
    leverage the services of someone else (like Dominoes) more than that in case of IaaS to further reduce
    your workload.
### 4. Software As A Service(SaaS)
    You can go to a restaurant. Use their own dining. Order a pizza with a drink and enjoy it. In terms of
    Cloud Computing, this process is termed as Software As A Service(SaaS) where you do nothing on your 
    own and ask someone else to do everything (Eg. Dropbox, Google Drive, etc).
